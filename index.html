        <h2>✨Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Freshman at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I live in Chennai. I'm a programming enthusiast. I love exploring new new things daily and I am always learning new stuff, improving my technical skills. As of now, I have a diverse set of skills, ranging from design to HTML + CSS + JavaScript and a bit of React.
          I'm not yet strong in Data Structures and Algorithms but I'll master it soon. I have always been passionate about Web development, which led me to pursue Bachelor of Computer Science degree. 
          I am constantly seeking out new Web technologies and learning about trends in the industry.

        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in data. I promise

          I will not produce harmful code.

          The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly release code that is defective either in behavior or structure.

          I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

          I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

          I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve the code at every opportunity. I will never make the code worse.

          I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

          I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

          I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

          I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
